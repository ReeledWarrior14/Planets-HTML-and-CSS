                <p>Similar in size and structure to Earth, Venus has been called Earth's twin. These are not identical twins, however – there are radical differences between the two worlds!</p>

                <p>While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface! Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal!</p>

                <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere! Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past!</p>

                <p>Jupiter has a long history surprising scientists—all the way back to 1610 when Galileo Galilei found the first moons beyond Earth! That discovery changed the way we see the universe!</p>

                <p>Adorned with thousands of beautiful ringlets, Saturn is unique among the planets! It is not the only planet to have rings—made of chunks of ice and rock—but none are as spectacular or as complicated as Saturn's!</p>

                <p>The first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star!</p>

                <p>More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye and the first predicted by mathematics before its discovery! In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846!</p>
